# NYC CitiBike Analysis
## Purpose
For this analysis, we'll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we’ll create a set of visualizations to:


-Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

-Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

-Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, we’ll add these new visualizations to the two we created in this module for our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Summary

This analysis has provided insight into the utilization of bicycles in NYC with Citibike.  This data can now be used to help support with learning trends on overall usage in the NYC area.  It is noticed that the highest time of useage of the bikes are around morning and afternoon commute times during the week, whereas there tends to be a more even spread of useage throughout the day on the weekends.  It would be helpful to conduct an analysis to compare the weekend trip durations to weekday trip durations.  It would also be helpful to look further into those bikes that receive higher useage as well as those in areas that do not receive any use.
